## Device Connection Flow (Simulated for Hackathon)

Since no physical scanner is available, the device connection flow will be **simulated**:
- Mock "Connect scanner" gate screen with simulated discovery
- Simulated Bluetooth pairing animation
- Mock scanner readings with realistic data
- "Scanner busy" and "Connection lost" states available for demo
- Disconnect/handoff flow after scan completion

### Data Association Rule
- Every scan session attached to current user's profile and selected face region
- Scanner transmits measurements but does not store identity
- App stores: scan_timestamp, region, scanner_quality, and user context

## Results Explanation Templates

### Template A: Acne Tile
- **Improving + high confidence:** "Your acne metric is improving compared to your baseline. Routine adherence has been consistent, and there were no major confounders detected."
- **Worse + period window:** "Your acne metric rose during your predicted cycle window. This pattern often reflects hormonal variation. Consider keeping your routine stable for the next few days and avoid introducing new actives."
- **Worse + new product:** "Acne metric worsened soon after a new product was introduced. This may be a confounding change. Consider pausing the new product to isolate what's driving the shift."
- **Worse + poor sleep/stress:** "Acne metric increased on days with lower sleep / higher stress signals. This may indicate lifestyle-driven fluctuation rather than a product effect."

### Template B: Sun Damage Tile
- **No sunscreen + worse:** "Sun damage metric increased alongside low sunscreen use. The highest-impact change is daily AM sunscreen and reapplication on high-exposure days."
- **High UV location:** "Given your location, UV exposure is likely elevated right now. Protective steps (sunscreen + shade) will have outsized impact."

### Template C: Skin Age Tile
- **Texture improving:** "Skin age metric improved primarily due to texture/roughness changes compared to baseline."
- **Plateau + low adherence:** "Skin age metric hasn't shifted meaningfully yet. Inconsistent routine adherence can slow visible change -- consider simplifying to improve consistency."

### Escalation Language (non-diagnostic)
- "Your metrics changed rapidly and the trend is unusual for your baseline. This isn't a diagnosis, but it may be worth sharing a report with a clinician for context."

## Scoring Algorithms

### Design Principles
- All scores are deterministic given the same inputs (no randomness)
- Weights are grounded in established dermatology assessment methodologies
- Scores range 0-100 where higher = worse condition
- Context modifiers (sleep, stress, cycle) use evidence-based effect sizes

### Primary Score Derivation

#### Acne Score
Base = inflammation_index × 0.65 + texture_index × 0.20 + pigmentation_index × 0.15
- Weight rationale: GAGS (Global Acne Grading System) correlates inflammatory lesions as primary (~65%), comedonal texture secondary (~20%), PIH residual (~15%)
- Context modifiers: poor sleep (+6), high stress (+8), late luteal phase (+10), early follicular (+5), no sunscreen (+3), new product (+4)

#### Sun Damage Score
Base = pigmentation_index × 0.70 + inflammation_index × 0.15 + texture_index × 0.15
- Weight rationale: UV-induced pigmentation is primary photoaging marker (~70%), erythema (~15%), texture degradation (~15%)
- Context modifiers: no sunscreen (+8), poor sleep (+2), high stress (+3)

#### Skin Age Score
Base = texture_index × 0.55 + pigmentation_index × 0.25 + inflammation_index × 0.20
- Weight rationale: VISIA-type analysis prioritizes texture/roughness (~55%), solar lentigines (~25%), chronic inflammation (~20%)
- Context modifiers: no sunscreen (+4), poor sleep (+5), high stress (+3)

### Composite Signals (Overall Skin Health)
5 signals weighted to produce overall score:
- Structure (22%): inverse of texture + age risk
- Hydration (18%): inverse of texture + acne risk + lifestyle penalties
- Inflammation (20%): inverse of inflammation + acne risk
- Sun Damage (20%): inverse of sun + pigmentation risk
- Elasticity (20%): inverse of age + texture risk

### Signal-Specific Analysis Pipeline (3-Layer)
Each signal now has its own biologically grounded measurement via a 3-layer parallel pipeline:

**Layer 1 — Deterministic Image Processing** (~100ms, `backend/image-processing.js`):
- CIELAB a* erythema map → inflammation (validated: r=0.89 vs Mexameter, Stamatas 2004)
- ITA variance + solar lentigo count → sun damage (validated: Flament 2013)
- Specular reflection ratio + LBP entropy → hydration (validated: r=0.72 vs Corneometer, Batisse 2002)
- GLCM texture + green channel pore proxy → structure
- Forehead wrinkle energy (Frangi-inspired) → elasticity

**Layer 2 — Custom CV Models** (~200ms, `backend/signal-models.js`):
- Structure: MobileNetV3 (pore count + texture regularity)
- Hydration: EfficientNet-B0 (Gabor+LBP features)
- Elasticity: EfficientNet-B0 (Frangi wrinkle quantification)
- Lesion detection: YOLOv8-small (comedone, papule, pustule, nodule, macule, patch)
- Models loaded from ONNX; graceful fallback to Layer 1 when not available

**Layer 3 — Fine-tuned GPT-4o** (existing, ~3-5s):
- Holistic condition classification, pattern recognition, personalized feedback, RAG recommendations

Score merging: Layer 2 overrides > Layer 1 + Layer 3 weighted blend (0.6/0.4 for CV signals, 0.7/0.3 for deterministic-primary signals)

### Confidence Levels
- Low: < 3 scans (insufficient data for trend)
- Medium: 3-6 scans (emerging pattern)
- High: 7+ scans (reliable trend established)

### Escalation Threshold
- Flag triggered when any primary score changes > 20 points from previous reading
- Triggers non-diagnostic advisory: "Consider sharing a report with a clinician"

- **7-day free trial**: replaces 3-free-scan model; `startTrial()`, `isTrialActive()`, `trialDaysRemaining()`, `canScan()` rewritten
- **Onboarding paywall**: `app/onboarding/paywall.tsx` — inline RevenueCatUI, skip starts trial, purchase completes onboarding
- **Daily scan notifications**: `src/services/notifications.ts` + `app/onboarding/scan-reminder.tsx` — time picker, schedule/cancel daily reminders
- **Products tab**: replaced Trend tab with full product management — routine score ring, ProductCard with effectiveness rings, AddProductSheet (search/barcode/manual), FAB
- **Profile updates**: trial days remaining, notification settings section (enable/disable daily reminder)
- **New components**: `ProductCard.tsx`, `AddProductSheet.tsx`
- **Dependencies added**: `expo-notifications`, `@react-native-community/datetimepicker`
- **Build #24** submitted to TestFlight with all changes

### Deferred (post-launch)
- HealthKit/Health Connect native integration (requires EAS bare workflow)
- PDF export for clinician reports (currently stub)
- Session replay via PostHog (currently disabled)
- Deploy ONNX models to Railway (115MB total, needs LFS or external hosting)
- Remaining medium-priority bugs: streak duplication, TodayScreen dead code, duplicate DB schema (see memory/bugs_audit_20260317.md)

12. Scan Reminder (time picker for daily notifications)
13. Camera Permission (pre-permission screen + system dialog)
14. Ready (luminous orb animation → paywall)
15. Paywall (RevenueCatUI inline, skip starts 7-day trial)

### Flow architecture
- Dynamic flow array via `buildOnboardingFlow(sex, menstrualStatus)` in `src/services/onboardingFlow.ts`
- Flow stored in Zustand: `onboardingFlow[]` + `onboardingFlowIndex`
- Conditional screens (menstrual/cycle-details) inserted based on sex answer
- Dot progress indicator adapts to actual flow length
- Product scanning and baseline scan moved to post-onboarding first-launch actions

### Design patterns (Headspace-inspired)
- One question per screen, max 1 heading + 1 subtext + 1 primary CTA + 1 skip
- Fade transitions between screens (no lateral slides)
- Staggered fade-with-rise entrance: illustration (0ms) → heading (120ms) → subtext (220ms) → content (300ms) → buttons (400ms)
- Geometric organic SVG illustrations per screen, teal-dominant on dark background
- `OnboardingTransition` wrapper component for consistent layout and animations
- `OnboardingOptionCard`, `OnboardingGridOption`, `OnboardingChip` for selections

### Permission timing
- **Camera:** Requested on Screen 12 after trust justification, persisted on user profile
- **Location:** Requested on Screen 4 when user chooses "Use my location"
- Both follow Apple HIG "explain before you request" pattern

### UserProfile extensions
- `sex`, `menstrual_status`, `on_hormonal_birth_control`, `birth_control_type`
- `supplements[]`, `exercise_frequency`, `shower_frequency`, `hand_washing_frequency`

## Authentication Flow

### Redirect Logic
- **Root layout** (`app/_layout.tsx`) contains `AuthRedirector` component that returns only `<Redirect>` components or `null` — never its own navigator
- When Clerk is configured:
  - `!isLoaded` → animated splash (index.tsx)
  - `!isSignedIn` → redirect to `/auth/sign-in`
  - `isSignedIn` + `!onboarding_complete` → redirect to `/onboarding/welcome`
  - `isSignedIn` + `onboarding_complete` → render normal tab navigation
- When Clerk is not configured: demo mode with onboarding/demo buttons

### Screen Inventory
- `app/auth/sign-in.tsx` — email/password + OAuth (Apple, Google) with staggered entrance animations
- `app/auth/sign-up.tsx` — account creation with email verification + 60s countdown timer
- `app/auth/forgot-password.tsx` — password reset via Clerk reset_password_email_code strategy
- `app/auth/_layout.tsx` — fade_from_bottom transitions, 400ms duration

### Animation Specs (Headspace-inspired)
- Staggered entrance: 400-600ms per element, `Easing.out(Easing.cubic)`
- Error shake: `withSequence(-6, 6, -3, 0)` on error container translateX
- Success: content fade out (400ms), orb scale to 1.2, haptic notification
- Orb entrance: scale 0.3→1 over 800ms, glow pulse with 2s cycle
- Shared animation utilities in `src/utils/animations.ts`

### Dependencies
- `expo-haptics` for success feedback

## Product Intelligence

### Ingredient Knowledge Base
- `src/services/ingredientDB.ts` contains ~45 ingredient profiles
- Categories: retinoid, AHA, BHA, antioxidant, humectant, emollient, sunscreen_active, peptide, surfactant, preservative, fragrance, other
- Each profile includes: clinical efficacy (0-100), side effect risk (0-100), goal relevance, signal relevance, description, evidence citation

### Effectiveness Scoring Algorithm
1. Base score: 50
2. Per-ingredient: `clinicalEfficacy * goalRelevance[goal] / 500` (scaled -5 to +10)
3. Side effect penalty: `sideEffectRisk * 0.08` per concerning ingredient
4. Personalization: +3 bonus when ingredient helps a struggling signal (<50), -3 extra penalty when ingredient hurts a struggling signal
5. Goal alignment bonus: +8 when 2+ goal-relevant ingredients present
6. Fragrance penalty: -5 unconditional
7. Clamped 0-100

### Product Detail View
- `app/product/[id].tsx` — full ingredient breakdown, goal alignment, usage tips, related signals
- Effectiveness badges shown on profile and onboarding product lists
- Color coding: >=75 success, >=55 primary, >=35 warning, <35 error

## UX Plan Completion Verification

To ensure the frontend UX plan is tracked and auditable, the execution checklist is maintained in `ux_progress.txt`.

- The UX tracker maps completion status to each major journey and interaction design objective.
- MVP-critical UX flows are marked complete; placeholders and stretch integrations are explicitly called out as in-progress or pending.
- This separation prevents stretch-goal gaps from being mistaken as core plan failures during demo readiness reviews.
